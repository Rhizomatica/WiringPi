WiringPi (Rhizomatica's Fork)
=================================

This is an unofficial fork of wiringPi which supports newer Linux distributions and kernel versions.  This repository is a temporary Rhizomatica's WiringPi fork for use in HERMES project, which works on all versions of Debian Linux, and all Raspberries Pi up to and including version 4 (for Raspberry Pi 1 or early 2 revisions, edit wiringPi/wiringPi.c and change gpioLayout to 1). Raspberry Pi 5 support will be merged soon from upstream. An alternative to WiringPi is [gpiolib](https://github.com/raspberrypi/utils/tree/master/pinctrl), which is the Raspberry Pi Foundation's reference implementation for GPIO access.
